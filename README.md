## 📌 About The Project

This project was created to showcase my skills and projects in a modern, attractive, and interactive way.  
It goes beyond a static site by including a full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** system for projects, managed through a secure, password-protected admin panel.

The frontend is designed with a focus on great user experience, featuring smooth animations and a sleek, dark-themed design.
